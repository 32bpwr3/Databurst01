About the Cyber Management and Communication Task Force

Sometimes referred to informally as "Cyberland Security," the Cyber Management and Communication Task Force was launched on September 2003 with the mission of monitoring and cataloging an ever-expanding Internet. The usage of the word "cyber" convey's the task force's broader responsibility of enforcing laws, investigating and explaining new developments in computer technology, and exploring the ever exchanging culture of those who "live" online.
