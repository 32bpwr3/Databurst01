<p>Big Changes coming to Radio Shack</p>

<p>I found it very disheartening to hear about the changes coming to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wnem.com%2Fstory%2F28040378%2Fsprint-to-set-up-shop-as-radioshack-files-for-bankruptcy%23ixzz3QxmeFGp7&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgzyDwwsvxPXuyYOF0n9tZ6LLazA">Radio Shack in the near future</a>. Sure, the company is filing for bankruptcy protection, so it will still be around, but I don’t think it will ever be the same again. There are already plans to close some stores, including the local one that I’ve been shopping at for years.</p>

<p>As much as I love stopping at Radio Shack, this news doesn’t come as much of a shock. I know that the company has been struggling for a while and has made several attempts to improve business. But, the fact of the matter remains that the Radio Shack stores don’t ever seem very busy, unless you count Black Friday.</p>

<p>For me, this has been the type of store that I stop for three possible reasons: Find something that’s cheap or on clearance, I need a part or a gadget that is hard to find at other stores, or I’m in the mood to browse an electronics store.</p>

<p>We don’t have a lot of selection when it comes to electronics here in Mid Michigan, unless we want to drive 40 minutes to the nearest Best Buy in Midland. There is WalMart, Staples, Target, and Radio Shack, but only Radio Shack specializes in electronics.</p>

<p>For all of these years, Radio Shack has been that type of store that always seemed to be in every town. I could visit the one in Brighton when I was younger. I considered applying for a job at a Radio Shack.</p>

<p>I made some of my most interesting purchases at Radio Shack. It’s where I bought my customizable, FX lightsaber with dual blade colors (blue or red). I’ve bought several docks there, as well as cases and jackets for my Apple devices.</p>

<p>So, I hope that they turn things around and someday return to my area.</p>
