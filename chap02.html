<p>I would love to work with you to create a community-oriented writing subject focussed around the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival. Students between third and higher could easily share some thoughts, or interview community members and report on what they learn. I would then coordinate with you to upload the best stories to the SMSF website and Facebook page.</p>

<p>This could also be turned into a research assignments, perhaps centered around the history of the festival. Contact me if youâ€™re interested.</p>
