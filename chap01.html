<p>Help Tell the story of Shepherd’s Maple Syrup Festival</p>

<p>Despite all of the geekiness that comes with maintaining the Facebook page and website for the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival, I like to think of myself primarily as a storyteller. That’s because my goal between now and April 26, 2015 will be to tell the story about what happens throughout the Festival, and try to explain why its an event that nobody should miss.</p>

<p>That happens via the festival brochure, and the event information on the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqCuOealjHlzhDF9pVz9ubqPRdxg">website</a>. But, there is also the deeper story which marketing material can’t tell about the residents of a village getting together to have a good time. Or, the more personal story about what the festival means to my family.</p>

<p>So, I’m inviting everyone to share their personal story about the Maple Syrup Festival. How long have you been attending? What has it meant to you and/or your family? What have been your favorite memories? Favorite events?</p>

<p>Have you volunteered in the past during the Festival? If so, what did you do? How long have you been volunteering?</p>

<p>I hope to collect as many stories as I can and publish the best ones between now and Festival weekend.</p>
